In HCPSS, overall course grades are the only grades that show up on your high school transcript. They are calculated based on quarterly grades and exam grades. Use this calculator to predict your overall course grade for a yearlong class.

'grades_php' is the page hosted on https://dhruvi.me/grades, with minor differences on the front-end with ocasionally edited notices or links, but the PHP code remains consistent.

'grades_script.php' is a PHP script of identical function that can be used offline or run in a PHP sandbox to calculate grades, if perhaps the website is not functioning properly.
